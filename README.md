# Sowlutions-CoderByte-take-home-exercise

Steps tp running the small project:

I recommend using vscode.

1- Install Git (if you have not already installed it).

2- Open a terminal in the folder where you want the project.

3- Run:
git clone https://github.com/Johnnygereige/Sowlutions-CoderByte-take-home-exercise.git

then

cd Sowlutions-CoderByte-take-home-exercise

4- Inside vscode, Install an extension called "Live Server".

5- after you successfully downloaded the extension, go to the index.html file, right click, and click on Open with Live server

OR

you can alternatively, just in the folder when you have all the files for this project, you can open the index.html using any browser.

And just like that, you can run the program and make sure it 100% works.

Enjoy
